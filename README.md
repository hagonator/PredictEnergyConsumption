# Predicting the energy consumption of a building

--- University Research Project ---

## Task
Given detailed characteristics of buildings, the goal is to predict their Energy Usage Intensity (EUI).
The quality of a given model is evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
For more details see the [task file](task.pdf) provided by the professor.

## Approach
1. Initial exploration of the dataset to get familiar with available characteristics, present datatypes and more technical aspects like missing data or distributions of characteristics.
